## Notes

This was my first attempt at many things, I had not programmed on a mac before this project as I am used to Ubuntu 18.04,
I had also never used Xcode before or studied Swift or even created a UI. All these factors gave way to a very interesting 
learning experience but diving in and sadly having a tight schedule due to exam reschedules made me learn so much through a 
day that I am glad I attempted my best at this project. The hardest part was getting started as I was very overwhelmed at first,
however there is so much documentation plus the codePath videos available that it was really not difficult to become entranced.
I rarely found myself frustrated thanks to these resources.
